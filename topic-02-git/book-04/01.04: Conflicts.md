# Conflicts

What are conflicts, and how do they happen?

Conflicts in git occur when trying to integrate changes from two different
states, where different changes are made in one place. The most common case is
when performing a *merge* of one branch into another, where there's a change to
a particular line in a particular file on both sides of the merge.

Git doesn't know what to do automatically, so it just stops in the middle of
the action, and asks you to intervene.
