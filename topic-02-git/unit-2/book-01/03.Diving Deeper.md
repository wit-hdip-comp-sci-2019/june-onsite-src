# Diving deeper

We covered quite a lot in the previous practical. Let's go in depth on some of
the topics covered.

## Adding (Staging) and Committing

When performing a *git add* we mentioned the "staging area". This is one of the
three sections of a git project:

* The working directory - This is all the files in your current directory. This
is where files are modified before being staged.

* The staging area - This is where changes are added during *git add*, when a
commit is created the changes in the staging area will be the contents of the
commit.

* The repository - Changes that have been committed and persisted.

## Lifecycle of files

There are two states of a file in git:

* Tracked files - This is any file that is in the previous commit, or currently
staged.

* Untracked files - Any file that is not a tracked file.

A tracked file can be:

* Modified: Changes have been made since the previous commit, but are not
staged.

* Staged: Changes have been made since the previous commit, and those changes
are staged.

* Unmodified: No changes have been made to the file since the last commit.
