# Branches

Branches make working with commits easier

A branch is just a reference to a commit, it has a human-readable name
and identifier. Instead of using the SHA-1 hash to reference a commit we can
now use the name of a branch.

When creating a repository using `git init` a branch named 'master' is created
for us, it is currently pointed at our latest commit.

Let's designate 'master' as the branch for our main line of development,
anything on that branch should be stable. If we want to test out new features
without breaking the main line then we can create new branches.
