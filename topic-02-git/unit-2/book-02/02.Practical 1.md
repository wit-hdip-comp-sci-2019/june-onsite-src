# Practical One

We want to add a new file to our current project, but we don't want to mess up
'master'.

## View the current branches

We can see all of the branches in our repository.

```bash
git branch
# stdout: master
```

## Create a new branch from master

To add our new feature we want to add a new branch. Our new feature is adding
information about our favourite animal so let's call the branch something
descriptive like 'favourite-animal'.

```bash
git branch favourite-animal
# If we do a 'git branch' now we'll see our new branch is created, but we're
# still on master. Let's 'checkout' our new branch.

git checkout favourite-animal
```

Now that we have our branch created let's take a look at our commit history
using `git log`, this will give us information about what commit each branch is
currently pointing to.

## Make some changes

Let's make some changes to our new branch and commit them.

```bash
echo 'My favourite animal is a <your-favourite-animal>!' > animal.txt

git add animal.txt
git commit -m "Add favourite animal"
```

We now have a repository that looks like this.
