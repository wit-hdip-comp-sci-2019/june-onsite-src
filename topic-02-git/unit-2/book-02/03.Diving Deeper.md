# Diving deeper

## Branches under the hood

Branches are stored in the `.git/refs/heads` directory as files. If we view the
contents of any of these files they just contain the SHA-1 hash of the commit
the branch is currently pointing to.

```bash
cat .git/refs/heads/favourite-animal
```

## HEAD

When we were doing `git log` you may have seen 'HEAD' mentioned in the log.
HEAD points to whatever is currently checked out. At the moment we have the
'favourite-animal' branch checked out so it will point to that. HEAD is a file
in the `.git` directory.

``` bash
cat .git/HEAD
# stdout: ref: refs/heads/favourite-animal
```
