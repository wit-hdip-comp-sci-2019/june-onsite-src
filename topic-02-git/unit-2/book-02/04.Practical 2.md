# Practical Two

We have created a branch that has information about our favourite animal. Now
let's create another branch from master and add information about our favourite
TV show. We are currently on the branch 'favourite-animal'. We need to create
our new branch from master.

```bash
# Create a new branch named favourite-show from the branch master
git branch favourite-show master
git checkout favourite-show
```

We'll leave the rest to you.
