# Practical One - Fast-forward merging

The simplest form of merging is *fast-forward* merging. Since branches are just
references to commits, and 'favourite-animal' is a direct descendant of master;
we can just update master to point to the same commit as 'favourite-animal'.

This is the default way that git will merge when the target branch is an
ancestor of the source branch. First, `checkout` the target branch (master in
this case), and then use the `merge` subcommand to bring the changes from the
source branch (favourite-animal) into this branch:

```bash
git checkout master

git merge favourite-animal
```

Master and the 'favourite-animal' branch are now pointing at the same commit.
We can delete the 'favourite-animal' branch.

```bash
git branch -d favourite-animal
```
