# Rebasing

Time to rewrite history

# Overview

Why rewrite history?

* Git is not only a source control tool, it is also a communication tool
    * Order of commits, logical grouping, good commit messages help to communicate changes
    * Think of the person reviewing your PRs as a potential axe-murderer. Axe murderers hate fix-up commits.
* Golden rule: Never rewrite history on shared/public branches

# Visualise

Rebasing and Merging are two methods that achieve the same goal - the integration of changes from one branch into another branch
