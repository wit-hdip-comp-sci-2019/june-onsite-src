# Git objects - what are they?

* Blob - Think of blobs as file contents (deflated) with a size & type header.
* Tree - Trees refer to blobs (and other trees), similar to how a directory points to files (and child directories).
* Commit - Commits consist of a tree, parent commits, metadata (message, author details, time, etc).
* Tag - An annotated tag is an object type that points to another object, and contains metadata such as timestamp, tag name, description, tagger and gpgsig. Most commonly refers to a commit.

## Inspecting Objects with git cat-file

```bash
# What type of object is it?
$ git cat-file -t $(git rev-parse HEAD)
commit

# What size is it (in bytes)?
$ git cat-file -s e29b7eef219e38d005b1360214322a336a56729e
1079

# Pretty-print it
$ git cat-file -p $(git rev-parse HEAD)^
