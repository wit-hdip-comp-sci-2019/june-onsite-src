# Hooks

Do something before or after a particular action

Git hooks are scripts that Git executes before or after events such as: commit, push, and receive. Git hooks are a built-in feature - no need to download anything. Git hooks are run locally.

* Server-side hooks: we can't use them because of Github. Use webhooks instead
* Client-side hooks:
  * 'git am' hooks: we don't use 'am', so we don't care
  * Commit:
    * post-commit
    * commit-msg
    * prepare-commit-msg
    * pre-commit
  * Others
    * pre-rebase
    * post-checkout
    * post-merge
    * pre-push
    * pre-auto-gc
    * post-rewrite

```bash
# everything you need to know about each hook
man githooks
```
