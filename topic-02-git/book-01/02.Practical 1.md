# Practical One

## Create a new repository

Before we create our first commit, we'll need to create a repository.

Create a new directory.

```bash
mkdir git-workshop
cd git-workshop
```

Initialize a git repository, we will see a hidden `.git` directory created in
the current directory. Let's not focus on that too much at the moment.

```bash
git init
# stdout: Initialized empty Git repository in...

ls -a
# stdout: .    ..   .git
```

## Create a commit

We have our repository created. Let's create a new file with some text inside
it.

```bash
echo 'Hello, World!' > hello.txt
```

We can now add the `hello.txt` file to the staging area, ready to be committed.
Any future changes to `hello.txt` will not be included in the commit we create,
unless we add them too.

```bash
git add hello.txt
```

Finally we can create a commit using the contents of the staging area, and
include a descriptive message of our changes.

```bash
# Alternatively we can just do 'git commit', which will open up an editor to
# enter the commit message.
git commit -m "Add hello.txt"
```

We have created a commit, now let's create another one by making some changes
to `hello.txt`. We'll leave this one to you, but our change could look
something like:

```bash
echo 'My name is <your-name>!' >> hello.txt
```

## Viewing commit history

We have two commits created, let's take a look at the commit log.

```bash
# To exit the log simply press 'q'
git log
```

The commits are ordered in reverse chronological order. Each commit item
contains the SHA-1 hash of the commit, the author, the date the commit was
authored and the commit message. We can use the SHA-1 hash of the commit to
reference it when using other git commands.

For example, we can *checkout* a commit:

```bash
git checkout <commit-sha-1>
cat hello.txt
# stdout: Hello, World!

# Use 'git checkout -' to checkout the previous commit.
git checkout -
cat hello.txt
# stdout: Hello, World! My name is <your-name>
```
