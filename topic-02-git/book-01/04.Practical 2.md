# Practical Two

Now we know a bit more about staging and the lifecycle of a file, let's have a
look at the lifecycle in action.

First, let's create a new untracked file.

```bash
echo 'My favourite colour is <your-favourite-colour>!' > colour.txt
```

Now we want to see the status of the current project.

```bash
git status
```

It tells us we have an untracked file called 'colour.txt'. As we haven't
changed the contents of 'hello.txt' it is unmodified and does not show by
default.

If we `add` 'colour.txt' to the staging area and check the status again we will
see git is now telling us the file is staged or ready to be committed, the file
is now also tracked.

```bash
git add colour.txt

git status
# Note that the output also tells us how to unstage the file, using git reset.
```

Now let's change the contents of 'hello.txt', the file will then become
modified and this will be shown when running `git status`.

```bash
echo 'I am doing a Git workshop!' >> hello.txt

git status
```

Finally `add` and `commit` all of the changes.
