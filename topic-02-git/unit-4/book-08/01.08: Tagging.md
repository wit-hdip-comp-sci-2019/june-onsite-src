# Tagging

Tags are like branches, except they don't usually change

There are two types of git tags - annotated and lightweight

* We’re going to only cover lightweight tags today (you’ll see these more often)
* A lightweight tag is like a branch that does not change
  * Pointer to a specific git-ref.
  * Unlike annotated tags, it is not a full object in the Git DB (not annotated, not-checksummed, not signed, no metadata about the creator)
* Lightweight tags - under the covers
