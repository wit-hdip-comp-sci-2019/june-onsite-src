# Merging

Like road merging but for branches

In the last section, we learned about creating new branches. Often branches are
created temporarily to work on a specific piece of work. When that work is
ready, then those changes are brought back into the main line again.

Remember the branches from the last section? Originally there was the master
branch, and then we created a branch called 'favourite-animal', where we made
changes. We can now merge those changes back into master branch, and delete the
'my-new-branch' since we won't need it anymore.
