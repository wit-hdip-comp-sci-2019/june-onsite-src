# Practial Two - Merge commits

In some cases, the target branch will not be a direct ancestor of the source
branch. This is the case for our 'favourite-show' branch. Here, the default
action is to create a new commit which has two (or more) *parent* commits and a
message.

While on the master branch, we can now merge the changes from the
'favourite-show' branch as follows:

``` bash
git merge favourite-show
```

The default commit message editor will have appeared here, to give you the
opportunity to modify the commit message for the new commit. The default is
usually fine.

Usually a *merge commit* will not contain any changes to files itself. The
changes will be in its ancestors. Sometimes when merging two divergent branches
though, there will be conflicting changes on either side of the merge. In this
case, there may be changes needed in the merge commit to resolve the conflicts.

It is worth checking the log here to see the commit history.
``` bash
git log
```
